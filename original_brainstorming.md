App Idea: Meal/Recipe app
What: Our idea is a recipe app. Users might search by ingredients and get recipes. We might include social features such as rating/liking/commenting on recipes, user photos of recipes, showing trending recipes, etc.

Who: The app is for people who want to try new recipes and get ideas for what to cook. 

Why: Some people want a bit of guidance or social proof when deciding what to cook. 

Challenges: We are considering various ideas for where the recipes come from, including ways to include generative AI APIs in addition to recipe APIs.
